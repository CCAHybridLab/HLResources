| **[Two Pin Buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1481)** | These switches are standard input "buttons" on electronic projects and have two modes <b>(On & Off).</b> The buttons work by two pins that are normally open (disconnected) and when the button is pressed they are momentarily closed causing a reaction in response.  

- Start by connecting the buttons to the breadboard. We will be using: (ON üî¥ & OFF üîµ) 
- Using the jumper wires connect the (+) for the ON üî¥ to Pin 12 & the (+) for the OFF üîµ to Pin 10.
- Using the breadboard, connect ground to the Arduino. 
- Connect your Arduino to your laptop.
- Copy the code below and read the comments to understand how it works. 
<br> </br>
> üí° **Tip:** Always double-check your wiring before powering on your circuit to avoid damaging components.

**Arduino Code:** <br /> 
```C++
const int button_OnPin = 12; // On button is connected to digital pin 12
const int button_OffPin = 10; // Off button is connected to digital pin 10

void setup() { // Set pin modes

 Serial.begin(9600); // Intialize serial communication on Arduino to send data
 pinMode(button_OnPin, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Button 1 uses internal pull-up (pin reads HIGH when unpressed, LOW when pressed)
 pinMode(button_OffPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Button 2 uses internal pull-up (pin reads HIGH when unpressed, LOW when pressed)
}

void loop() { // Read button states; INPUT_PULLUP means unpressed = HIGH, pressed = LOW
                                                  
int button_OnState = digitalRead(button_OnPin);   // Button 1 state (starts HIGH = not pressed)
int button_OffState = digitalRead(button_OffPin); // Button 2 state (starts HIGH = not pressed)

if (button_OnState == LOW) { // Button is pressed (LOW because pin connects to GND when pressed)
  Serial.println("Button 1 PRESSED");
}

 if (button_OffState == LOW) { // Button is pressed (LOW because pin connects to GND when pressed)
   Serial.println("Button 2 PRESSED");}

 delay(50); // Add a small delay to debounce the buttons
}
```
Test out the code and look at the <strong> Serial Monitor </strong> to see if the buttons are connect correctly. 
<br> </br>
‚úÖ If the serial monitor reads "Button PRESSED", you did it! Move on to Step 2.

| **[MOSFET Module Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1481)** | The IRF520 MOSFET Driver Module lets a low-power control signal (from microcontrollers such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.) switch on the MOSFET to allow high-power voltage to flow to components such as motors, LED strips, solenoids and more. 

A microcontroller sends a signal to the SIG pin, which activates the MOSFET and connects the circuit through GND. This ‚Äúopens the gate,‚Äù allowing an external high-voltage source (connected to VIN and GND) to power your load. Your component connects to V+ and V-, which deliver the high-voltage power to the device.

> üìù  **Note:** If the SIG signal is high (e.g., 5V), the MOSFET turns on, and current flows. If the SIG signal is low (0V), the MOSFET is off, and no current flows through.

| **[Electric Heatpad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1481)** | Most heating elements on the market demand high power and are often impractical for hobbyists and makers. The Adafruit 10cm x 5cm Heating Pad is different. Powered by 5V, its stainless-steel fibers generate heat in a thin, flexible fabric‚Äîperfect for wrapping, bending, or integrating into wearable projects. 

- Start by connecting the MOSFET Driver to the heatpad/peltier using V- (for ground) ‚ö´ and V+ (for power) üî¥. 
- Next connect the barrel jack to the MOSFET using VIN & GND.
- After that conect the MOSFET to the Arduino using SIG on Pin 13 and GND.  
- Connect your Arduino to your laptop.
- Power the MOSFET using a 5V - 12V / 1A external power supply plugged into the barrel jack. 
- Copy the code below and read the comments to understand how it works. 
<br> </br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** The heatpad runs safely on 5V / 1A, but for stronger heating it can be driven with up to 12V, but do not go above 1A as this will damage components.

**Arduino Code:** <br /> 
```C++
// Define pins for the MOS Module
const int heatPadPin = 13;        // Output signal to the MOS Module

// Timer variables
unsigned long heatPadStartTime = 0;
const unsigned long maxOnDuration = 30000; // 30 seconds in milliseconds

bool heatPadOn = false;

void setup() {
 // Set pin modes
 pinMode(heatPadPin, OUTPUT);      // MOS Module control pin

 digitalWrite(heatPadPin, LOW);  // Ensure heating pad starts OFF

    digitalWrite(heatPadPin, HIGH);
   heatPadOn = true;
   heatPadStartTime = millis(); // Record the start time
}

void loop() {

 // Check if the heating pad has been on for too long
 if (heatPadOn && (millis() - heatPadStartTime >= maxOnDuration)) {
   digitalWrite(heatPadPin, LOW);
   heatPadOn = false;
 }
}
```
Test out the code and test the heatpad to see if it feels warm.
<br> </br>
‚úÖ If the heatpad feels warm and turns off after 30 seconds, you did it! Move on to Step 3.

The sensor is composed of two ultrasonic transducers. One is transmitter which outputs ultrasonic sound pulses and the other is receiver which listens for reflected waves. It‚Äôs basically a SONAR which is used in submarines for detecting underwater objects.
